This repository contains two projects:
-A "Battleship" one where you have two versions of the game, one where you can play human vs human, and another one where you play against the computer that calculates what move it should make based
on "probability map" theory.
-A "Snake" one (called snakeg) where you have a version where you can play by yourself, and another one where the computer plays and uses the A* path-finding algorithm to know what moves it should make.
